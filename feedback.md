## How do you think you did?
I feel like I have done the project well and also was able to add some extra style elements to learn a bit more.  I think that I ticked off all of the requirements in the rubric so that my code is clean, the site is responsive and accessible, and the site fits the design brief. 
## Did you struggle with any parts of the assignment?
I didn't struggle with any aspects.

The assignment was really well thought out.  It combined all of the elements we had learned, was easy to understand and at the right level of complexity.
